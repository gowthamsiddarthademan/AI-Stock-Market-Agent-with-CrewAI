**Companies Not Selected and Why:**

*   **Vodafone Idea:** Vodafone Idea was not selected due to its high risk profile. The company faces significant challenges, including heavy debt, widening losses, and intense competition in the Indian telecom market. While there may be short-term gains based on potential investments or government support, the company's financial fundamentals remain weak, with negative book value, low interest coverage, and decreasing promoter stake. The company's long-term viability is uncertain without significant financial restructuring and improved performance, making it a speculative investment with a high risk of loss.
